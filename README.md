A Q&A web application is an interactive platform where users can ask and answer questions, fostering knowledge-sharing and engagement within a community. This Q&A web app, designed using React for the frontend, Flask for the backend, and MongoDB as the database, ensures a seamless user experience with secure authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their sessions efficiently. The platform enables users to post finance-related questions with relevant tags, edit or delete their own posts, and participate in discussions through comments. To maintain content quality and security, an admin panel is integrated, allowing administrators to approve or reject posts, manage questions, and oversee platform activity. By incorporating these features, the application not only facilitates meaningful discussions but also ensures a structured and moderated environment for users, demonstrating your proficiency in full-stack development, security, and database management.
